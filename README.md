## Features

- Each quote includes the text, author, and a formatted blockquote.
- Lightweight and easy to integrate.

## Installation

You can install **quote-guru** via npm:

```bash
npm install quote-guru
```

## Usage

Hereâ€™s how to use the library in your project:

### Import the Library

```javascript
const QuoteGuru = require('quote-guru');
```

### Create an Instance

```javascript
const quoteGuru = new QuoteGuru();
```

### Get a Random Quote

To get a random quote, use the `getRandomQuote()` method:

```javascript
const randomQuote = quoteGuru.getRandomQuote();
console.log(randomQuote);
```

### Sample Output

The output will be in the following format:

```json
{
    "quote": "Sometimes things become possible if we want them bad enough.",
    "author": "T.S. Eliot",
    "blockQuote": "<blockquote>&ldquo;Sometimes things become possible if we want them bad enough.&rdquo; &mdash; <footer>T.S. Eliot</footer></blockquote>"
}
```

## JSON File Structure

The quotes are retrieved from a JSON file located in the `assets` directory. The file should have the following format:

```json
[
    {
        "quoteText": "Your quote here.",
        "quoteAuthor": "Author Name"
    },
    {

    }
]
